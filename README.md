# Star System Simulator


## Overview

Dive into the cosmos with this Star System Simulator! This simulator is designed to provide a dynamic visualization of celestial mechanics. It highlights the orbits of planets around their star. With this tool, you can model the orbits of our solar system's planets or create a whole new star system.


## Features

Create systems with any number of planets orbiting a single star. Tailor your system by specifying

- Star properties: Define your central's star position, radius, and mass.

- Planet properties: Set up planets with custom positions, radii, mass, and initial velocities to watch their orbits evolve.


## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/nataliaraymundipinheiro/star-system-simulator.git
```

### Usage

Navigate to the project's directory. To launch the simulator with a default system, simply paste

```
python3 main.py
```

in the directory's terminal.


## Future Directions

Currently, the simulator is very simple. It does not model the physics of collisions or the more complex interactions between each structure. It only models the interaction forces between bodies.
